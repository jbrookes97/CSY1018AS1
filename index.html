      <main><img src = "web%20dev2.jpg" alt = "joshua brookes"><p1><br> My Name is Joshua Brookes and I am currently a student at the university of northampton studying computer science, I chose computer science as it is something that I have always found enjoyable and challenging and as such wanted to pursue as a career. Prior to starting university I studied computing at A level and went on to work in the field for a year which I found very Enjoyable, however I decided that I wanted to pursue a greater career in the field as such I set out to get my degree.<br><br>After completing my degree I hope to work as a software developer, as I enjoy programming in langauages such as Java and C#, primarily during my work we used C# with a mySQL backend to support it and a xamarin forms overlay for mobile compatibility.
